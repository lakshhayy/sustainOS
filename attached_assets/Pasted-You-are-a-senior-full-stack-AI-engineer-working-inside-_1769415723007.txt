You are a senior full-stack + AI engineer working inside a single Replit workspace.

Your task is to BUILD (not just design) a working prototype of an
AI-Driven Sustainability Operating System called "SustainOS".

This is a SYSTEMS project.
Focus on correctness, clarity, and end-to-end flow.
Avoid overengineering.

=====================================================
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS (FOLLOW STRICTLY)
=====================================================

1. Use ONE Replit workspace
2. Use folder-based architecture
3. Ensure all servers can run locally in Replit
4. Mock data is allowed and encouraged
5. Simplicity > accuracy > scale
6. Everything must work with minimal setup

=====================================================
PROJECT STRUCTURE (CREATE THIS FIRST)
=====================================================

/
├── frontend/        (React app)
├── backend/         (Node.js + Express API)
├── ai_service/      (Python AI microservice)
├── README.md

=====================================================
SYSTEM GOAL
=====================================================

Build a Sustainability Operating System that:

1. Accepts sustainability data (electricity, water)
2. Predicts future demand
3. Simulates sustainability policies ("what-if")
4. Recommends optimized actions
5. Explains decisions to administrators

This is NOT a dashboard-only app.
It is a decision-making engine with a UI.

=====================================================
FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS (React)
=====================================================

Inside /frontend:

- Use React (Vite or CRA)
- No authentication needed
- Clean admin dashboard UI

Pages to implement:

1. Dashboard Page
   - Show total electricity & water usage
   - Show predicted vs actual usage (chart)
   - Show peak usage warning text

2. Policy Simulation Page
   - Form inputs:
     - AC temperature limit (number)
     - Usage reduction percentage
     - Incentive enabled (true/false)
   - Submit policy for simulation
   - Display returned results:
     - Estimated cost savings
     - Carbon reduction
     - Comfort score (0 to 1)

3. Recommendations Page
   - List recommended actions
   - Each item must show:
     - Action
     - Why it is recommended
     - Expected impact

Use:
- React
- Simple chart library (Chart.js / Recharts)
- Fetch data from backend APIs

=====================================================
BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (Node.js + Express)
=====================================================

Inside /backend:

- Use Node.js + Express
- This backend is the ORCHESTRATOR
- Do NOT implement ML here

APIs to implement:

1. POST /data/usage
   - Accept mock time-series data
   - Store in memory or simple JSON (Mongo optional)

2. GET /forecast
   - Call Python AI service
   - Return predicted usage

3. POST /simulate
   - Accept policy parameters
   - Forward request to Python AI service
   - Return simulation results

4. GET /recommendations
   - Return AI-generated decisions

The backend must communicate with the Python service via HTTP.

=====================================================
AI SERVICE REQUIREMENTS (Python)
=====================================================

Inside /ai_service:

- Use Flask or FastAPI
- This is the INTELLIGENCE LAYER

Endpoints to implement:

1. /forecast
   - Input: historical usage
   - Output: next-day and next-week prediction
   - Use simple logic (moving average / regression)

2. /simulate
   - Input: policy parameters
   - Simulate impact on:
     - Resource usage
     - Cost
     - Carbon footprint
     - Comfort score
   - Use explainable heuristic formulas

3. /recommend
   - Compare multiple policies
   - Choose best trade-off:
     - Cost vs carbon vs comfort
   - Return explanation in plain English

IMPORTANT:
- NO complex ML required
- Focus on explainability
- Logic must be easy to understand

=====================================================
DIGITAL TWIN & RL (SIMPLIFIED)
=====================================================

Implement a conceptual "digital twin":
- Use historical data as environment
- Test policy actions on it

Reinforcement Learning can be mocked:
- Iterative policy improvement loop
- No RL libraries required

=====================================================
RUNNING IN REPLIT
=====================================================

- Ensure frontend, backend, and ai_service can run
- Use different ports
- Provide clear run instructions in README.md

=====================================================
DELIVERABLE
=====================================================

Produce:
- Working frontend UI
- Working backend APIs
- Working AI service
- End-to-end data flow
- Clear comments
- README with setup + explanation

This prototype should clearly demonstrate:
Prediction → Simulation → Recommendation → Explanation

BEGIN BY:
1. Creating folder structure
2. Implementing backend
3. Implementing AI service
4. Connecting frontend
